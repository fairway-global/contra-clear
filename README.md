# ContraClear OTC

Institutional crypto OTC desks today settle trades through manual wire transfers, custodian-mediated movements, or trust-based arrangements that introduce counterparty risk, settlement delays, and operational overhead. A buyer can send payment and never receive tokens, or a seller can deliver tokens and never get paid. Settling directly on a public blockchain like Solana solves the trust problem but introduces a new one. Every trade is visible on-chain, exposing order sizes, counterparties, and strategy to the entire market. ContraClear solves both by using the Contra payment channel: an off-chain settlement layer where trades execute with instant finality and full privacy, while assets remain secured by Solana's on-chain escrow. The result is the entire OTC lifecycle: RFQ negotiation, KYC attestation, and escrow-locked settlement in one platform where neither party can default because the operator only releases funds when both sides have committed, and no trade details ever hit the public ledger.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd otc-server && npx tsx src/index.ts

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd otc-frontend && npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Webhook (for KYC)
cd webhook && npx tsx src/server.ts
```



## Demo Accounts

All use password `contra123`:

| Email | Role |
|-------|------|
| `rfq@contraotc.dev` | RFQ Originator (KYC bypassed) |
| `lp@contraotc.dev` | Liquidity Provider (KYC bypassed) |
| `admin@contraotc.dev` | Admin |

## Trading Flow

1. **RFQ** — Originator creates an RFQ (sell token, amount, buy token)
2. **Quote** — LP submits a quote with price. Counter-quotes supported.
3. **Accept** — Originator accepts a quote. Both parties deposit escrow tokens on-chain into the Contra channel.
4. **Settlement** — Each party signs a transfer of their tokens to the operator. When both have signed, the operator releases tokens to the correct recipients server-side. This is atomic — tokens are held by the operator until both parties commit.

## Settlement (Operator-Escrow)

The Contra channel has ~20s blockhash validity, making multi-signer transactions impractical. Instead, the operator acts as escrow:

1. Party A clicks "Sign Settlement" → builds fresh tx (A → operator) → wallet signs → submitted instantly to Contra
2. Party B clicks "Sign Settlement" (any time later) → same flow (B → operator)
3. Backend detects both deposits → operator signs and submits two release txs server-side with fresh blockhashes:
   - Operator → B (sell token)
   - Operator → A (buy token)

Channel ATAs for receiving tokens are auto-created by the backend via `channel-ata.ts` (operator deposits 1 raw unit with `recipient` parameter).

## Contra Channel

Contra is an off-chain payment channel with instant finality. Users deposit SPL tokens on Solana into the escrow program — tokens appear on the channel. Withdrawals reverse the process.

- Gateway RPC: `http://35.228.38.233:8899` (Solana JSON-RPC compatible)
- Channel uses `TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID` for ATAs (not Token-2022)
- All demo tokens are Token-2022 on Solana devnet with 6 decimals
- `getBalance` and `getTransaction` are not supported on the gateway
- `getSignatureStatuses` works for verifying tx execution

## KYC/KYB

Zyphe integration (sandbox). Individual users go through KYC, institutions through KYB. On verification, a SAS attestation is created on Solana. Admin users and demo accounts (`rfq@`, `lp@`, `admin@`) bypass KYC.

## Faucet

`/faucet` route in the frontend. Mints up to 1000 of any demo token (USDC, USDT, EURC, PYUSD, USDG, USX, CHF, GBP, JPY, SGD, AED) to any wallet on devnet.
